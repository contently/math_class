# math_class

### Background

Welcome to the landing page of the _Contently Math Class_! The hope here is that we can all have some fun while diving into some of the knowledge and technique that allows for thinking _quantitatively_.

To achieve this, we will make use of the _Python programming language_. Please note that this is not meant to be a "how to write Python" class. I.e. our focus will be not on the code but on the numbers, and we will generally write simplistic representations of our desired logic. That said, you will gain exposure to writing analytical Python through these courses. 

### Tools

Our lesson content will come in the form of _Jupyter notebook_. This is a browser-based, interactive coding tool that allows you to keep code, charts, and text in the same place. _GitHub_ will be used for distributing these notebooks. If you have any questions on how to use Jupyter, please don't hesitate to reach out at any time. I imagine you will pick this up pretty quickly.

That said, it's hard to beat a good 'ol fashioned pen and paper for math, and if you'd like to participate in this way you should please feel free to do so! This will work for many, though not all of the classes. You're welcome to try to follow along in other languages, too - this may mean that you are on your own with respect to implementation details, which will likely become more of a problem as we get farther along. You should feel free to experiment as you wish - you can always come back to working in Python.

If you do wish to use Python, I would recommend using at least version 3.6. You will also need to install the `jupyter` package. Additionally, the following analytical libraries would be helpful to have ready-to-go:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `statsmodels`
- `requests` (this is for HTTP - always handy to have installed)

The simplest approach for folks who don't already have a good Python set up is likely to download and install the _Anaconda_ Python distribution, which will include all of these packages and also many others. You can download this from [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Frepo.continuum.io%2Farchive%2FAnaconda3-2018.12-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg&sa=D&ust=1547655216810000&usg=AFQjCNE5LRmMSVTwl_SzMrp3iGGaA-Maaw).

### Additional

We have a few months's worth of topics described above. If the class is working well - i.e. folks are learning and enjoying - we can continue on with some additional topics, such as _Autoregression_ (regressing data against itself, which can prove quite effective for modeling time series data) and _Robust Statistics_ (a sub-field of Statistics that provides techniques that hold up in face of outliers).

Furthermore, depending on interest, we can let this evolve from a "math class" to something more like "intro to data science." But first, we need our fundamentals :)
